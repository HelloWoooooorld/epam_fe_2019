                        <p>Before we sign a contract or write a line of code our team will spend the necessary time needed
                            to understand your product vision. The outcome of this scoping session is a proposal or
                            high-level statement of work.</p>
                        <p>Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or just the pieces you need.</p>

                        <p>Our design practice offers a full range of services including branding strategy, interaction and
                            visual design and user experience testing. Throughout your project, our designers create and
                            implement visual designs and workflows, solicit user feedback, and work with you to make sure
                            what gets built is what is needed.</p>
